A typing speed test I wrote according to the tutorial from https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQ5i1kJAA6Y .

I modified it and added the possibility to abort the test while its running and displayed wrong white space by adding a red underscore.

Known issues:
- programm crashes on line 73, if a non ordinance key is pressed. For example up arrow.
- programm crashes, when ESC is pressed, while the wpm test is running.
